Code for helping with math research (Hodge theory)

  1. hodge.py: compute hodge numbers for hypersurfaces in P^n

  2. hodge_numbers.sage: compute hodge numbers for hypersurfaces in P^n,
     in weighted projective space.  Also compute hodge numbers for cyclic
     covers and hodge numbers of the eigenspaces of the covering automorphism.

  3. shioda.sage: for computing quantities associated with the character
     spaces which decompose the primitive cohomology of the  Fermat
     hypersurface.

(2) is better developed than (1), and (2) does everything that (1) does.

These modules replace the old Maple code in Hodgepack.
